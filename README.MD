# I am currently learning C, why? Because I'm bored.
My end goal in this is to learn to make an operating system, but before that I need to learn assembly, hexadecimal, all that boring stuff, so I'm going to start with C, and (maybe) C++, then move onto assembly.
The stuff I am learning is very simple, and not enough to make an operating system. I just need to learn the basics first, which this is good for. For learning the basics, I will be using `https://www.w3schools.com/c/c_intro.php`. For future learning about malloc, low level I/O stuff, I will be using `https://learn-c.org/` and `https://archive.org/details/TheCProgrammingLanguageFirstEdition`, but that will be in a different repo. Once I learn advanced C, I will move to assembly. (Different repo). And then I'll move onto a VERY big project which it'll be unlikely I complete, for those I will be using `https://wiki.osdev.org/`, `https://github.com/cfenollosa/os-tutorial`, and `https://littleosbook.github.io/`

Each script will have its own `compile.sh`, this is because I have no idea how to make it just run normally from visual studio code, so I have to do this. You will have to change `compile.sh` to however you do it on windows or macos, if using those. `no idea why you would want to copy these scripts though`

If you want to suggest what to do, please do because I have no idea what I'm doing. You can give me a suggestion in issues or add me on discord, `.divinesean`
